## Workshop title: Introduction to GIS with R

## Workshop Description
A variety of research fields include the handling of spatial data. While there are many options of software to process geographic information, using a programming language would help you make your work reproducible and easy to customize in the future. In this workshop, we will cover basic concepts of geographic information systems (GIS) and how to analyse and visualize different types of spatial data in R. We are going to track whales and sharks and investigate for seasonality in ocean water temperatures, but the examples provided are not limited to biological sciences and could be applied by any researcher interested in analysing spatial data with R.

## Presenter
Yuri Niella is a PhD candidate in the Marine Predator Research Group (Department of Biological Sciences - Macquarie University) interested in how the spatial and trophic ecology or large coastal sharks are being affected by anthropogenic stressors such as climate change, fishing and habitat loss.
